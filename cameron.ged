2 CONT   CHAN DATE 21 MAR 1998
2 CONT 
2 CONT From Andrew Jackson Marsh's account of his ancestry for his son, Stanley Marsh
2 CONT Your great-grandfather was born in or about Rahway in the year of 1797 [actually, December 18
2 CONC , 1796].  He was the youngest of three children, Lotta B. Marsh, Elias Marsh, Elias Marsh an
2 CONC d George T.
2 CONT Marsh.  Their parents both died young and I think they were partially reared by their grandmo
2 CONC ther.  He spoke of her as being a little woman, weighting about ninety pounds, that she onc
2 CONC e told him that she went to school with Aaron Burr, that 'he was the prettiest black eyed bo
2 CONC y in school, but was always a bad boy,'  the Burr episode is probably correct for as grandfat
2 CONC her was born in 1797 the youngest of three children, his grandfather must have been fifty yea
2 CONC rs of age at least at the time of his birth, which would carry it back to 1747.
2 CONT The Revolutionary War began in 1775, and Burr was about twenty-one years of age at that time
2 CONC .  Burr's father was a noted educator and was president of Princeton College during Aaron Bur
2 CONC r's childhood.  Princeton is very close to Rahway, so the known facts appear to corroborate h
2 CONC is grandmother's statement.
2 CONT [ed.:  Aaron Burr (1756-1836) Cousin of Theodore Dwight; father-in-law of Joseph Alston. Bor
2 CONC n in Newark, N.J., February 6, 1756. Member of New York state assembly, 1784; New York stat
2 CONC e attorney general, 1789-90; U.S.  Senator from New York, 1791-97; Vice President of the Unit
2 CONC ed States, 1801-05. Killed Alexander Hamilton in a duel, July 11, 1804. Tried for treason i
2 CONC n in 1807 and acquitted. Died, after several strokes, at the Winants Hotel, Port Richmond, St
2 CONC aten Island, N.Y., September 14, 1836. Interment at Princeton Cemetery.] I do not now recal
2 CONC l his making any reference to his immediate parents or to any of his ancestors except his gra
2 CONC ndmother, although he may have done so, I being quite a young man at the time and may have fo
2 CONC rgotten it.  He did state, however, that some of the older ancestors were well to do financia
2 CONC lly and of some prominence in the local history of the colony, one being a member of congres
2 CONC s or some public position of that kind.  It may have been in the Revolutionary Congress.
2 CONT Between the years of 1815 and 1820 grandfather, his brother and sister emigrated from New Jer
2 CONC sey to Cincinnati, which was then a small struggling village.  It ws before the days of railr
2 CONC oads, and almost before steamboats.  They came over the Alleghany mountains by wagon or stag
2 CONC e to Pittsburg, Pennsylvania from there on a raft down the Ohio river to Cincinnati.  Lott
2 CONC a  B. soon married a man named Smith and left descendents some of whom are still living in an
2 CONC d around Cincinnati.
2 CONT The two boys engaged in business of different kinds in the village as it was then.
2 CONT Your great grandfather Marsh first married a lady Smith by whom he had three children, Locke
2 CONC y Marsh, Daniel Marsh and your grandfather David Marsh.  When your great grandfather was abou
2 CONC t forty years of age he being a widower, married a widow Hannah Hedges, a former sweetheart o
2 CONC f his younger days, her maiden name being Hannah Johnson.  She was born and reared on the Joh
2 CONC nson farm in the Miama river bottom about a mile and a half from Venice.  She was eight year
2 CONC s younger than grandfather, being born in 1805.
2 CONT She first married a man named Hedges and was left a widow with three chldren, all daughters
2 CONC , her husband had considerable land and the homestead and about sixty acres was set off to he
2 CONC r as dowry.
2 CONT Grandfather married her, I should say about 1836, moved from the city with his three childre
2 CONC n to her farm and lived there until he died about thirty-five years.  Why he moved from the c
2 CONC ity, I do not know, as he was fairly well off financially and had a good business there.
2 CONT Probably his wife didn't want to leave the country and the children being small the country b
2 CONC eing the best place for them.
2 CONT He had three children by the second marriage - Sarah Marsh, Andrew Marsh and George Marsh.  S
2 CONC arah Marsh married a man named Gilliland, moved to Illinois, I think Bloomington.  Andrew Mar
2 CONC sh went to Nashville, Indiana to learn the tannery trade with his half brother, Daniel Marsh
2 CONC , when he was about nineteen years old.  While standing in the door of the shop during a thun
2 CONC derstorm he was struck by lightning and instantly killed.  The youngest George Marsh, marrie
2 CONC d a Miss Dick from Venice.  He was a farmer but was not a do-well.  He farmed around that nei
2 CONC ghborhood three or four years, spent all the money grandfather gave him to start on and a tho
2 CONC usand dollars of his mothers.  He had two children, emigrated to someplace in Tennessee.  H
2 CONC e was not vicious or a bad man in any point of view, but seemed to be a poor manager. He fel
2 CONC t rather above his station in life, wanted to be a gentleman farmer, which couldn't be doen i
2 CONC n those days without more money than he was able to command.  I see I've but the cart befor
2 CONC e the horse and have taken up the younger children first.  To go back to the older sett wit
2 CONC h whom we are most directly interested in .  Lockey Marsh, the eldest came out as a child wit
2 CONC h her father to the widow's homestead and lived there all her life.  She never married, she n
2 CONC ever having the opportunity.  She was highly emotional and was one of the best women I ever k
2 CONC new, generous to a fault and spent her life slaving in a way for the benefit of those aroun
2 CONC d her her position of course, in the family was a very subordinate one and her range of activ
2 CONC ities were very narrow.  Women in those days did not have the freedom that they have in these
2 CONC , they were kept more in a state of subjection and suppression.
2 CONT Daniel Marsh when he was grown moved to Nashville, Indiana, married and had a numerous family
2 CONC , boys and girls.  He was rather intemperate in his habits like some of the rest of us, and w
2 CONC hile he made a good deal of money for those times, he wasted a lot of it.
2 CONT About 1876 he moved with his family to some place in the state of Washington and died a yea
2 CONC r or two after he got there. No doubt you have a number of relative descendants from that fam
2 CONC ily in that state.
